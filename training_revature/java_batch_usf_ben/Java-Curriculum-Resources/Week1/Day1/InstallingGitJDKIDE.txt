Installing Git, JDK, IDE

Installation file for Git:
	https://gitforwindows.org/
	Use default editor (because I know the commads for that)

Installation file for JDK
	Install JDK version 8 (because we'll be showcasing that)
	https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html

Installation file for IDE (STS or Eclipse)
	Install STS version 3, version 4 removes some essential training features

	Also can use Eclipse, might need to switch later in the curriculum.
